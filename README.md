## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the DogProject, a Django web application developed for the CSE2252 Web Application Development Lab Final Exam. You will find the question of the exam in the [Questions.md](./Questions.md) file. The DogProject allows users to manage a list of dogs available in a DogShop through a RESTful API.

## Getting Started

To get started with the DogProject, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Django (3.2.6)
- Django Rest Framework
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/mdhasnainali/CSE2252-Web-Application-Development-Lab-Final-Exam.git
```

2. Change the directory to the project folder:

```
cd CSE2252-Web-Application-Development-Lab-Final-Exam
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: env\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Generate a secret key for Django settings:

```
python manage.py shell -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

Copy the generated secret key and paste it in the `DogProject/settings.py` file under the `SECRET_KEY` variable.

### Database Setup

1. Apply the migrations to set up the database:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

2. Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface (optional but useful for testing):

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the Django development server with the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

The development server should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
